# HoloToolkit-Unity
This is effectively part of the existing HoloToolkit, but this is the repository that will contain all Unity specific components.
The HoloToolkit is a collection of scripts and components intended to accelerate development of holographic applications targeting Windows Holographic.

**Current Unity Editor Project Version: 2017.2.0b4**

**Branch: HoloToolkit-Unity with Windows Mixed Reality support for immersive headsets.**

## Prerequisites:
1. See [Development PC specs](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/install_the_tools#developing_for_immersive_headsets) for tips on developing for immersive headsets.
2. [Holograms 100](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/holograms_100) has been updated with how to setup Windows Mixed Reality in your app.
3. [How to navigate the Windows Mixed Reality home](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/navigating_the_windows_mixed_reality_home).
4. Development PC needs to be on Windows Insider SDK and a Windows Insider build as below.
    1. Launch Settings > Updates and Security > Windows Insider Program > Get Insider Preview builds 
    2. Install the SDK found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewSDK).
5. Unity beta 2017.2.0 with Mixed Reality API support. This build of Unity can be found [here](https://unity3d.com/unity/beta).

6. [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).

## Please note:
1. We will not merge this branch into master until we have a publicly available non-beta Unity that supports it and a HoloLens build that works with these new APIs.
2. You can use this branch with Windows Creators Update builds on your PC and deploy it to Windows Anniversary Update HoloLens flight.
3. Windows Creators Update flights donâ€™t ship on HoloLens.

## What's new for Immersive headsets in this branch?

**GamepadInput** supports the Xbox controller and maps it to the input manager events.
You can use the Xbox controller A to tap.
Press A and hold to do hold started, canceled and completed.
Press A and left joystick to trigger the navigation events.
Press the Y button to teleport in your world.
Press the B button to return back to your original location.

**Motion Controller** support that renders a prefab where you have the Crytal Key motion controller in your hand. Refer to [MotionControllerTest.unity](https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloToolkit-Unity/blob/Dev_Unity_2017.2.0/Assets/HoloToolkit/Input/Tests/Scenes/MotionControllerTest.unity) scene for how to use the scripts.

**Teleport** capability with new prefabs like [MixedRealityCameraParent.prefab](https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloToolkit-Unity/blob/Dev_Unity_2017.2.0/Assets/HoloToolkit/Input/Tests/Scenes/MotionControllerTest.unity) that help you [teleport](https://github.com/Microsoft/HoloToolkit-Unity/blob/Dev_Unity_2017.2.0/Assets/HoloToolkit/Input/Tests/Scenes/MotionControllerTest.unity) to different locations in your app using the gamepad.

**Stage** folder has the scripts that support the StageRoot component that helps define the 0,0,0 for your immersive applications.
Prefabs help to draw the floor for immersive headsets and also renders the stage bounds if you wish to display those in your application.

**External\How To** docs folder is meant to help everyone with migrating forward or any simple doubts they might have about the process.
Please feel free to grow all these sections. We can't wait to see your additions!

We've also done some future proofing work to add support for motion controllers. 
However, current model is gaze and commit with your head gaze and the Xbox controller.
